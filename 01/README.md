# Chapter 1 - The traditional "Hello World" with a few fun variations.

A silly tradition in the world of computer programming is to have as a first,
simple example a program the displays the text "Hello World". This tutorial is
not going to break with this tradition.

If you did'nt do so already in chapter 0, lets run the first demo program:

    ruby 01\demo_00.rb

and see the first of the "Hello World" demo programs. Press escape when we are
done being amazed by the awesomeness of it "Hello" and the worldliness of its
"World"

Now we crack into the code that makes this trivial program tick.
