# Appendix B - Some Words of (Hopefully) Wisdom.

Now I begin this section with the conceit that I have any words of wisdom to
convey to the reader. It is true that I have been programming for a very long
time, but length of service does not always lead to excellence. I can only
say these are truths that I know and hope that they will be of some use.

The games lessons tutorial is different from most published works in that it
was designed from the outset to be hosted on github. Why? and why care? With
the possible exception of inscrutable Zen masters and liars, the creative
process is by nature an iterative one. Most content creators don't want anyone
to see any of the details of how they arrived at the completed work. We only
get to see the polished end product as if it emerged perfect like
[Athena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena#Birth) from the head of Zeus. I
recall one avid photographer who was of the opinion that all evidence of less
then perfect results should be destroyed to preserve the mystique of the
great artist. Sorry guy, but to me, such thinking is disingenuous and counter-
productive. Programming is a processes, full of refinement, updates, reckless
hacks, and improvements. Teachers should never pretend to be perfect and there
can be no greater prize than to have your pupils accomplish great things.

That is why, with the help of github, you get to see the progression toward the
released versions of the code. Also notice I didn't say "perfection". In
programming there is no perfection, only improvement or deterioration.
