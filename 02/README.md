# Chapter 02 - Getting the ball rolling.

OK, now a lot of games have a ball. Well I'm sure the games themselves don't
have a ball as they are just programs and cannot experience emotions like
joy or frustration... well not YET. Further, while the players may have a ball,
many games, contain one or more balls.

While some of you may have your minds in the gutter, I am going with balls as
spherical (or ellipsoid in some cases) rubber or plastic sports equipment
objects with various sizes and elasticity. Standing up for your beliefs and
principles in the face of severe adversity and opposition isn't bad either but
that is off topic.

Were going to use the ball to get our game past the still life phase and into
some sort of movement and eventually our first interactive manipulation of
objects in our nascent game.
