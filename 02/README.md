# Chapter 02 - Getting the ball rolling.

OK, now a lot of games have a ball. Well I'm sure the games themselves don't
have a ball as they are just programs and cannot experience emotions likes
joy or frustration... well not YET. Further, while the players may have a ball,
many games, contain one or more balls.

Were going to use the ball to get our game past the still life phase and into
some sort of movement.
