# Writing Games in Ruby with Gosu

This package contains several simple demonstration programs for creating
simple games and graphics in Ruby through the Gosu gem. What lessons can be
learned from this? Well writing games is a great way to learn and improve
programming skills while having some FUN!

Please note: You'll now need Ruby 2.3 or later as Gosu has dropped its
support for versions older than that. That is as far as I know. I am not 100%
certain on this point.

## Usage

(Coming soon --- Oct 16, 2018)

    $ gem install gosu

Then to run a demo you would use:

    $ ruby 01\demo_00.rb

Enjoy the cool "Hello World"! Press Escape to exit when the thrill wears off.


## Contents

This tutorial is set up in chapters with each chapter in its own sub-folder.
Each chapter has its own README.md file that serves as a guide to the contents
of that chapter. This is designed to make it easy to navigate the course using
a combination of GitHub to view the text and running the programs locally. The
following are included.

---
* **Chapter 00** - Getting setup with Ruby and Gosu.
* **Chapter 01** - The traditional "Hello World" with a few fun variations.
---
* **Appendix A** - Some small utility programs that may be of help.
* **Appendix Z** - Some extra credits about why GUI programming was so awful.

More contents are under development at this time. Really!

## Running the Demo Programs

This tutorial contains a number of demonstration and utility programs. There
are two ways that these programs can be executed.

---

(**1**) From the games_lessons folder, in a command line session with access to Ruby
(please see Chapter 00 more on that) enter the following:

    ruby A\mapper.rb

Naturally substituting the path and name of the program you wish to run.

---

(**2**) Enter the following from any command line session with access to Ruby:

    games_lessons mapper

Naturally substituting the name of the program you wish to run. (Coming soon --- Oct 16, 2018)

## Time Sensitive Information

Modern computer programming environments change at an alarming pace. I recall
attending a meetup where they made a demonstration of running a two year old
web site. Everyone was astonished that it actually worked! They could not
conceive that code as **ancient** as two years old could still run at all!

Or in other (Latin) words: "Sic transit gloria mundi."

To this end, when I make a remark that may easily be swept away by the sands
of time, I tag on "---" and the date I made the observation --- Aug 17, 2018
