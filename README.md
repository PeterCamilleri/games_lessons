# Writing Games in Ruby with Gosu
(To the tune of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds ;-)

This package contains several simple demonstration programs for creating
simple games and graphics in Ruby through the Gosu gem. Writing games is
a great way to learn and improve programming skills while actually finding
a use for all the math you learned in school.


## Usage

    $ gem install gosu

Then to run a demo you would use:

    $ ruby demo_00.rb

Enjoy the cool "Hello World"! Press Escape to exit when the thrill wears off.


## What's Here

The following demo programs are available:

    demo_00.rb  -- A simple Hello World
    demo_01.rb  -- A spinning Hello World
    demo_02.rb  -- Another spinning Hello World
    demo_03.rb  -- Still another spinning Hello World
