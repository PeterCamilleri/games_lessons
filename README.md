# Writing Games in Ruby with Gosu

This package contains several simple demonstration programs for creating
simple games and graphics in Ruby through the Gosu gem. What lessons can be
learned from this? Well writing games is a great way to learn and improve
programming skills while having some FUN!

Please note: You'll now need Ruby 2.3 or later as Gosu has dropped its
support for versions older than that. That is as far as I know. I am not 100%
certain on this point.

## Usage

    $ gem install gosu

Then to run a demo you would use:

    $ ruby demo_00.rb

Enjoy the cool "Hello World"! Press Escape to exit when the thrill wears off.


## What's Here

The following demo programs are available:

    demo_00.rb  -- A simple Hello World
    demo_01.rb  -- A spinning Hello World
    demo_02.rb  -- Another spinning Hello World
    demo_03.rb  -- Still another spinning Hello World
