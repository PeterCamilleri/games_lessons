# Writing Games in Ruby with Gosu
(To the tune of Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds)

This package contains several simple demonstration programs for creating
simple games and graphics in Ruby through the Gosu gem. Writing games is
a great way to learn and improve programming skills while actually finding
a use for all the math you learned in school.


## Usage

    $ gem install gosu

Then to run a demo you would use:

    $ ruby demo_00.rb

Enjoy the cool "Hello World"! Press Escape to exit when the thrill wears off.


## What's Here

The following demo programs are available:

    demo_00.rb  -- A simple Hello World
    demo_01.rb  -- A spinning Hello World
    demo_02.rb  -- Another spinning Hello World
    demo_03.rb  -- Still another spinning Hello World
